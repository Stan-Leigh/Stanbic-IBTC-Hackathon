## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. On weekdays, Facebook posts should be made mostly in the evenings, and on weekends, posts should be made in the mornings. This is when Engagement is highest.
2. Informational posts should be posted on Facebook generally on **weekends** when Impressions and Reach are highest and more people would be able to see it. Posts that are meant to be interacted with like giveaway competitions should be posted more on **Thursdays**, when Engagement is highest and more people are likely to interact with posts.
3. More Facebook posts should be **Texts**, as this content type receives more engagement, impression and unique clicks than Photos and Videos.
4. Facebook posts that are videos should be as short as possible, ideally under 10 seconds because for videos more than 10 seconds in length, only **15%** of people watch the whole video. This number goes up to **56%** for videos that are 10 seconds or less in length.
5. Texts should be added to Facebook videos because **37.5%** of viewers watch the videos with the sound off.
