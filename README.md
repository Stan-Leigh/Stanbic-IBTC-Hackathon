## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. On weekdays, Facebook posts should be made mostly in the evenings, and on weekends, posts should be made in the mornings. This is when Engagement is highest.
2. More Facebook posts should be Texts, as this content type receives more engagement, impression and unique clicks than Photos and Videos.
3. Facebook posts that are videos should be as short as possible, ideally under 10 seconds because for videos more than 10 seconds in length, only 15% of people watch the whole video. This number goes up to 56% for videos that are 10 seconds or less in length.
